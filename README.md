# localPrintService

![Step](./res/capture.png)

This application allows you to select a printer and automatically print a PDF document through a web link. This tool is ideal for setting up a local service for receiving invoices or other periodic PDF documents. The application can be downloaded from my Github repository.

This application is developed in Visual Studio 2015 and uses Windows Forms and C# as a desktop application. This means that it runs on a local computer and does not require an internet connection to work. The user interface is designed using the XAML markup language and can be customized according to the user's needs. In addition, the application is compatible with most printers on the market.

Some examples of useful applications for this application are:

    In an office where electronic invoices are regularly received, the application can be configured to automatically print invoices received on a specific printer.

    In a warehouse of a logistics company, the application can be used to automatically print shipping labels or delivery guides when a purchase order is received.

    In a hospital or clinic, the application can be used to automatically print medical reports or prescriptions when a request is received from a doctor.

    In a retail store, the application can be used to automatically print invoices or receipts when a purchase order is received.
